MvBACI
================

## Overview

The purpose of this pipeline is to conduct an analysis that evalutes
caribou movement before and after road interacations using a BACI
(before-after-control-impact) framework, with counterfactual pairings of
control (no road interaction) and treatment (interaction with road)
trajectories.

## About this repo

This pipeline is made using the targets pipeline toolkit.

- \_targets.R - this script runs all functions in the pipeline
- RunTargets.R - this script runs \_targets.R
- Scripts- all functions live here, mostly in Scripts/Functions.R
- Documents- images and scripts for the Readme

## Pipeline

This graphic describes the overall data processing and modeling steps,
and current status of coding each step.
